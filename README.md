# Dark prose.io theme

This is a custom theme for prose.io, you can install it manually or with [stylish](https://userstyles.org/styles/138903/dark-prose-io).

For now I'm content with inverting the colors of the original theme - with some adjustments and fixes of course.
Technically it's a beta version but as far as I know it's fully functional.

Tested on Chrome, Vivaldi and Safari.
